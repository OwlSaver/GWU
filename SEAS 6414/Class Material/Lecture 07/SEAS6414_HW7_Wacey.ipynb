    "The utilization of statistical techniques in financial sentiment analysis is often limited\n",
    "due to complexities in practical applications and a shortage of high-quality training\n",
    "data. In finance and economics texts, where annotated datasets are scarce and largely\n",

    "of the dataset, which corresponds to sentences with 100% agreement among the annotators. The analysis will center on sentences with unanimous annotator agreement, labeled\n",
